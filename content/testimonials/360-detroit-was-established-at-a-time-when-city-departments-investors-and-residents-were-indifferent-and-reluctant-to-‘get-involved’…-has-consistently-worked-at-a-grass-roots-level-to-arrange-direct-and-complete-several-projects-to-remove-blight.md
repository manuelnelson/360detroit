quote: 360 Detroit was established at a time when city departments, investors
  and residents were indifferent and reluctant to ‘get involved’…. has
  consistently worked at a grass roots level to arrange, direct and complete
  several projects to remove blight and improve the quality of life for those
  most neglected in Detroit’s resurgence.
